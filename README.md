### Hi there 😊

<![](https://github.com/Cherol08/Cherol08/blob/main/nikon.jpg)

I’m Cherol, The poetic programmer ☺️
I’m currently learning Python and Java, but interested in learning more languages. I'm into photography :camera: and I love writing short stories and poems
on my free time :memo:. 

I also happen to be a _phenomenal_ ukelele player :guitar: (sarcasm intended).

👯 I’m interested in collaborating on any cool projects so feel free to hit me up!

💬 You're welcome to ask me about anything regard my projects or programming.

📫 If you want to connect, feel free to follow my [twitter](https://twitter.com/CodeGhoul08) or find my email in the bio.


😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: I can also draw, so I'm quite artsy for someone uninterested in web development.
