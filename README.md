### Hi there 😊

I’m Cherol, The poetic programmer ☺️
Just finished a Software Engineering course at HyperionDev where I was focused on Python, Java and SQL. I'm also comfortably familiar with HTML and CSS but I'm interested in learning more languages. I'm into photography :camera: and I love writing short stories and poems
on my free time :memo:. 

I also happen to be a _phenomenal_ ukelele player :guitar: (sarcasm intended).

👯 I’m interested in collaborating on any cool projects so feel free to hit me up!

💬 You're welcome to ask me about anything regarding my projects or programming.

📫 If you want to connect, feel free to follow my [twitter](https://twitter.com/CodeGhoul08), or check out my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cherol-phoshoko-429aa421a/) profile.



😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: I can also draw, so I'm quite artsy.
